# TypeScript Express Application Starter

This repository provides a simple and ready-to-use environment for building web applications using TypeScript and ExpressJS. It includes all the necessary setup to help you get started quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the TypeScript Express application:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ts-express-dev.git
   cd ts-express-dev

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

2. **Build the Application**

   ```bash
   npm run build

3. **Start the Application**

   ```bash
   npm run build

## Development

During development, you can take advantage of the built-in development server and automatic code reloading. Run the following command to start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```


This will start both TypeScript compilation in watch mode and nodemon for automatic server restarts whenever you make changes to your code.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
